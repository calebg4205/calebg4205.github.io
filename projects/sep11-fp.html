            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The Freedom Project in SEP10 is a year project where we learn a JavaScript tool by ourselves!</p>
            <p>My project is a website that will translate based on the users geoposition and includes manual translation.</p>
              <h2>Content</h2>
            <p> For this project the website is made using React.js and Express.js. My partner, Jacob Levit, learned express and I learned react. We wanted to make a tool that would alllow immigrants to translate the website into thier forigen tounge. The page has a manual translation button in the middle of the page.</p>
              
            <h2>Reflection</h4>
          <h4>Challenges</h4>
                <p>While working on this project many challenges come to mind. Eventhough working with React has a lot of documentation, it was still very tricky to fifure out how to translate the langauage. Me and my partner has to use .JSON files to determine the languages. First my partner used an external API that got the users IP adress. After that he created an API that got translate the langauge based on the IP adress of the user. The challenge for me was that I had to use his translation in the frontend. Using the "t" function and componenets in React I was able to make a fetch the data from the backend and use it for the translation. The challenging part was learning how to do that. I had to learn complex JavaScript syntax like promies and await. It was difficult for me to understand but through YouTube videos and reading the documentation I was able to get the frontend to work.</p>
          
             <h2>Takeaways</h4>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Communication- Working with a partner requires that you communicate. Me and my partner often did seprate things then just pushed to the main branch. This resulted in a lot of errors and our code often broke. If we communicated more often we would have had less probelems. Towards the end of the project we would sit in the same room and code allowing us to talkk. This made it so much easier to avoid issues.</li>
                   <li>Problem Decomposition- While dealing with complex problems, breaking them into smaller parts alwways helps. No matter what we did we always broke a probelm up. Instead of coding large chucks at a time we would break it up. This led to a more stable workflow and allowed us to isolate any issues. First we noticed, then we wondered what went wrong and finally we tested a solution. This helped make our website work and fix many bugs.</li>
                 </ul>
  
              <h4>Next Step</h4>
            <p>If me and my partner decide to continue this project I would add more pages. Right now our website is only a prototype and doesn't actually have any information yet. So I would want to add resources and expand on the website to offer legal resources to immigrants.</p>
